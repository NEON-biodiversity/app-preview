This github pages repository  maps the development or 'preview' version of the Macrosystems-Explorer  shiny application
 to a preview URL within our github organization.  The actual hosted application is not in this repository, 
this is only an HTML 'shell' containing embed code (iframe)

The URL for the preview is http://neon-biodiversity.github.io/macrosystems-explorer-preview

All application code development takes place in https://github.com/NEON-biodiversity/MSBapp (private repository). 

For project information see The Macrosystems Biodiversity organization website : http://neon-biodiversity.github.io/
